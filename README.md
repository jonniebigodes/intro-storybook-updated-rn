# What is this

This is a sample repo used to make the changes to the intro to Storybook tutorial with React Native.

## What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── __mocks__
    ├── __tests__
    ├── .expo
    ├── .expo-shared
    ├── assets
    ├── components
    ├── constants
    ├── lib
    ├── navigation
    ├── node_modules
    ├── screens
    ├── storybook
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── App.js
    ├── app.json
    ├── babel.config.js
    ├── yarn.lock
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`__mocks__`**: This directory contains some global mocks to be used by Jest.

2. **`__tests__`**: This directory contains some tests that were bootstrapped by Expo CLI.

3.  **`.expo`**: This folder contains some configuration elements created by Expo

4.  **`.expo-shared`**: This folder contains some additional config elements relative to Expo.

5.  **`assets`**: This folder contains all the fonts and images used.

6.  **`components`**: This folder contains the components used in the tutorial and the accompanying story files.

7.  **`constants`**: This folder contains the styles implementation used in the tutorial

8.  **`lib`**: This folder contains the Redux store implementation


9.  **`node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

10.  **`screens`**: This folder contains all the screens used in the tutorial.

11. **`storybook`** This folder contains all the elements relative to Storybook, configuration, addons that are used and so on.

12. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

13. **`App.js`**: This file is the entry point for your app.

14. **`app.json`**: This file works as a type of manifest for your app.

15. **`babel.config.js`**: This file contains the babel configuration required to the app.

16. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

17. **`yarn.lock`**: (See package.json below, first). Both these files are automatically generated based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).** 

18. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
